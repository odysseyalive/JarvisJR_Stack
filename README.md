## Getting Started

### 1. Get a Server

We recommend Debian 12 servers from [Hetzner.com](https://hetzner.com) for their excellent performance and pricing:

- **Minimum Requirements**: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 40GB storage
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, 80GB storage

### 2. Create a User Account

Once your server is running, create a non-root user with sudo access and systemd permissions:

```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

```bash
adduser jarvis
```

```bash
usermod -aG sudo jarvis
```

```bash
loginctl enable-linger jarvis
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: The `enable-linger` command allows the jarvis user to run systemd services (required for Docker rootless). This prevents "Failed to connect to bus" errors during installation.

```bash
su - jarvis
```

### 3. Download the Script

```bash
curl -fsSL -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odysseyalive/JarvisJR_Stack/refs/heads/main/jj_production_stack.sh?$(date +%s)" -o jstack.sh
```

```bash
chmod +x jstack.sh
```

### 4. Configure Your DNS Records

**IMPORTANT**: Set up DNS records for your domain and subdomains before running the installation:

#### Required DNS A Records

Point these **subdomains** to your server's IP address:

```dns
supabase.your-domain.com    A    YOUR_SERVER_IP  
studio.your-domain.com      A    YOUR_SERVER_IP
n8n.your-domain.com         A    YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

**Note**: The root domain (`your-domain.com`) does **not** need to point to your server - only the subdomains are required.

#### DNS Setup Examples

**Cloudflare:**

1. Go to your domain's DNS settings
2. Click "Add record"  
3. **Enter ONLY the subdomain part** (not the full domain):

   ```
   Type: A
   Name: supabase          (NOT supabase.your-domain.com)
   IPv4 address: YOUR_SERVER_IP
   Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud)
   ```

4. Repeat for `studio` and `n8n`

**Other DNS Providers (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.):**

1. Access your domain's DNS management panel
2. Add New Record for each subdomain
3. **Enter ONLY the subdomain part**:

   ```
   Type: A / A Record
   Name/Host: supabase     (NOT supabase.your-domain.com)
   Value: YOUR_SERVER_IP
   TTL: 300-600
   ```

4. Repeat for `studio` and `n8n`

**Verification:**
You can verify your DNS setup with:

```bash
nslookup supabase.your-domain.com
nslookup studio.your-domain.com  
nslookup n8n.your-domain.com
```

All subdomains should return your server's IP address. The root domain verification is optional.

#### DNS Setup Troubleshooting

**‚ùì Not sure which format your DNS provider uses?**

- Most providers use **subdomain only** (`supabase`)
- Look for existing DNS records to see the format
- Try subdomain format first - most common

**‚è±Ô∏è DNS not updating?**

- Wait 5-15 minutes for DNS propagation
- Check TTL settings (lower = faster updates)
- Try `nslookup` from a different network/device

**üîç Wrong format entered?**

- If you see `supabase.your-domain.com.your-domain.com`, you entered the full domain when only subdomain was needed
- Delete the record and re-add with just `supabase`

**üåê Cloudflare Users:**

- Set proxy status to "DNS only" (gray cloud icon) during setup
- You can enable proxy (orange cloud) after installation if desired

### 5. Configure Your Settings

**IMPORTANT**: Edit the configuration at the top of the script before running:

```bash
nano jstack.sh
```

Update these required settings:

```bash

- `--backup before-testing` - Before testing new configurations  
- `--backup good-config` - After getting everything working perfectly
- `--backup pre-update` - Before system updates or modifications

Named backups make it easy to identify exactly what state you're restoring to!

**Restore from Backups:**

```bash
./jstack.sh --restore                   # Interactive selection menu
./jstack.sh --restore backup_file.tar.gz # Restore specific backup
```

**List Available Backups:**

```bash
./jstack.sh --list-backups
```

```
üìã Available Backups for your-domain.com:
==================================
backup_domain_20250107_203045.tar.gz | Size: 2.1G | Date: 2025-01-07 20:30:45
backup_domain_20250106_020000.tar.gz | Size: 2.0G | Date: 2025-01-06 02:00:00
```

### Interactive Restore Process

When you run `--restore` without specifying a file, you'll get an interactive menu:

1. **List all available backups** with numbers
2. **Choose by number** or enter full file path
3. **Confirmation prompt** before proceeding
4. **Automatic service management** (stop during restore, restart after)
5. **Verification checks** to ensure restore was successful

## Enhanced Uninstall System üÜï

The `--uninstall` command now provides complete system cleanup, removing **all** components including newer developments:

### What Gets Removed

- ‚úÖ **All Docker containers, images, secrets, and custom networks**
- ‚úÖ **Complete service data and volumes**
- ‚úÖ **Script-created directories from user home** (services/, backups/, logs/, scripts/)
- ‚úÖ **SSL certificates and internal certificate authority**
- ‚úÖ **GPG encrypted secrets and keyring cleanup**
- ‚úÖ **All systemd services, timers, and cron jobs**
- ‚úÖ **Security configurations** (AppArmor profiles, fail2ban, UFW rules)
- ‚úÖ **Docker installation** (optional, with confirmation)

### What Gets Preserved

- üõ°Ô∏è **User account** (`jarvis` user remains intact for safety)
- üõ°Ô∏è **User home directory structure** (only script-created content removed)
- üõ°Ô∏è **System packages** (can be removed manually if desired)

### Safe Uninstall Process

```bash
./jstack.sh --uninstall
```

1. **Warning and confirmation** - Type 'UNINSTALL-ALL' to confirm
2. **Graceful service shutdown** - Stops all containers cleanly  
3. **Complete cleanup** - Removes all script-created content
4. **User account preservation** - Keeps service user account intact
5. **Optional choices** - Keep or remove Docker installation
6. **System restoration** - Resets firewall and security settings

The uninstall process is designed to be **safe and reversible** - your user account remains intact so you can easily reinstall if needed.

## Troubleshooting & Maintenance

### Dry-Run Mode Improvements üÜï

Enhanced dry-run mode with better compliance checking:

```bash
./jstack.sh --dry-run
```

- **Zero system changes** - Guaranteed no modifications in dry-run mode
- **Comprehensive logging** - Shows exactly what would be executed
- **Compliance validation** - All commands properly wrapped and tested
- **Full configuration testing** - DNS, user, and system validations still run
- **Graceful failure handling** - Validation failures won't stop dry-run execution

**Note**: You can run dry-run mode **before** setting up DNS records or creating the service user - all validation tests will run and show you exactly what needs to be configured, but won't stop execution.

### Common Issues

**"Failed to connect to bus: No medium found" during Docker setup**

This happens with rootless Docker on Debian systems due to systemd environment issues. The script now automatically handles this by:
- Setting proper environment variables in ~/.bashrc
- Using Docker's custom runtime directory (/home/jarvis/.docker/run)
- Gracefully falling back if systemd integration isn't available

If you encounter this manually, the fix is:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger jarvis
echo 'export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/home/jarvis/.docker/run' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///home/jarvis/.docker/run/docker.sock' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Docker rootless will auto-start when first used even if systemctl fails.

**"Service user 'jarvis' does not exist"**

The jarvis user wasn't created properly. Create it manually:

```bash
sudo adduser jarvis
sudo usermod -aG sudo jarvis  
sudo loginctl enable-linger jarvis
sudo su - jarvis
```

### Log Locations

- **Setup logs**: `/home/jarvis/logs/setup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- **Backup logs**: `/home/jarvis/logs/backup.log`
- **Restore logs**: `/home/jarvis/logs/restore.log`
- **Service logs**: Available via `docker logs <container-name>`

### Quick Health Checks

```bash
# Check all services status
sudo -u jarvis /home/jarvis/scripts/status.sh

# View recent backup activity
tail -f /home/jarvis/logs/backup.log

# Check SSL certificate status
sudo -u jarvis /home/jarvis/scripts/ssl-status.sh
```

Installation typically takes 15-20 minutes on a good server connection. The system includes automatic health checks, self-healing capabilities, and comprehensive monitoring to keep your AI infrastructure running smoothly!
